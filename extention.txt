Step 1: Load Required Libraries and the Dataset
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)  # For data visualization
library(dplyr)    # For data manipulation
library(tidyr)    # For data tidying
 
# Load the Titanic dataset (assuming it's in your working directory)
titanic <- read.csv("pathâ€¦..titanic.csv")
If there are any issues in this we can discuss them, as we are using read csv for the first time.
Step 2: Explore the Dataset
Let's start by getting a sense of what the dataset looks like:
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(titanic)
# Get an overview of the dataset
summary(titanic)
# Check the structure of the dataset (data types)
str(titanic)
# Check for missing values
sapply(titanic, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
 
Step 3: Visualize Data
EDA often involves creating visualizations to better understand the data. Here are some common visualizations:
# Histogram of passenger ages
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Passenger Ages", x = "Age")
 
# Bar chart of passenger classes
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = factor(Pclass))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Passenger Class Distribution", x = "Class")
 
# Survival rate by gender
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Sex, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Survival Rate by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Proportion") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
 
 
# Scatterplot of age vs. fare
ggplot(titanic, aes(x = Age, y = Fare, color = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Age vs. Fare by Survival", x = "Age", y = "Fare") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "green"))
